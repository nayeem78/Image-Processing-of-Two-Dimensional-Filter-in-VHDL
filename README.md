# Image-Processing-of-Two-Dimensional-Filter-in-VHDL

The objective of our report is to process the data flow from the required image using a two dimensional linear filtering. We will read the given lena image dat file which consists of the pixel values and we will process this with the help of cache memory and processing module.
The resulted image is also used to apply different filters.
